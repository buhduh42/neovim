keeping a tally of things I need to implement/improve at some point in neovim

- See https://youtu.be/ZRnWmNdf5IE?si=axOC3HbcrEpY4fdT&t=705, integrate that help system

- cd in the nvim-tree window

- K prints help/man pages, properly set this up
- should probably add a way to navigate rusts documentation by going to the browser? think about it

- get a changelist with errors and warnings that I can navigate with

- do something along the lines of :setfiletype gdscript

************lsp stuff***********
- vim.lsp.buf.references
- lua vim.diagnostic.setfqlist({}) opens a quick fix list window, write a cool plugin for this with navigation and stuff
- hide show different severities, navigate, etc etc
- show type info of variable on hover(or something), maybe on a key press?
